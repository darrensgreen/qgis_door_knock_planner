# User Guide: Door Knock Route Planner

### 1. Introduction

The Door Knock Route Planner is a QGIS plugin designed to help plan and organise door-knocking campaigns for disaster management, major investigations, or search and rescue operations.

It takes a list of addresses, divides them among a specified number of field crews, and calculates the most efficient, ordered route for each crew to follow from a central starting point.

### 2. Before You Begin: Data Preparation

For the planner to work effectively, you need three essential data layers ready in your QGIS project. Using up-to-date and accurate data is highly recommended for the best results.

1.  **Area of Interest (Polygon Layer):** A polygon layer that defines the boundary of your operation (e.g., a suburb, a flood extent area, a search grid).

2.  **Address Points (Point Layer):** A point layer containing all the potential addresses to be visited. **Recommended (Australia):** For best results, use the latest version of the Geocoded National Address File (GNAF), available from [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/geocoded-national-address-file-g-naf).

3.  **Road Network (Line Layer):** A line layer representing the streets and roads the crews can travel on.

    A.  **Option A - Use Official State Data (Recommended):** For operations in Queensland, Australia, the authoritative **Queensland Roads and Tracks** dataset is recommended, available from [data.qld.gov.au](https://www.data.qld.gov.au/dataset/queensland-roads-and-tracks).

    B.  **Option B - Download from OpenStreetMap (Alternative Method):** If you do not have a road network file, you can download live data from OpenStreetMap directly within QGIS using the **QuickOSM** plugin. **How to use QuickOSM:**

        i.  Make sure your Area of Interest or flood model layer is loaded and visible on the map canvas.

        ii. Click the **QuickOSM** plugin icon in the toolbar.

        iii. In the QuickOSM window, go to the **Quick query** tab.

        iv. In the `Key` field, type `highway`. Leave the `Value` field blank to select all road types.

        v.  Click the dropdown menu that says `In` and change it to **Layer Extent**.

        vi. Select your Area of Interest or flood model layer from the adjacent dropdown menu.

        vii. Click **Run query**.

        **Note:** The larger the area, the longer this query will take. The plugin will download all roads within the boundary of your selected layer and add them to your map.

### 3. Step-by-Step: Running the Planner

1.  **Open the Tool:** In QGIS, open the **Processing Toolbox** panel (`View > Panels > Processing Toolbox`). Find the **Door Knock Planner** provider and double-click the **Door Knock Route Planner** algorithm.
2.  **Fill in the Parameters:**
    -   **Area of Interest (Polygon):** Select your boundary polygon layer.
    -   **Address Points:** Select your address point layer.
    -   **Road Network:** Select your road network layer (either from an official file or the `highway` layer downloaded from QuickOSM).
    -   **Start Location:** Click the `...` button to the right of the field. Your cursor will turn into a crosshair. Click on the map to set the starting point for all crews.
    -   **Number of Available Crews:** Enter the number of teams you have available.
3.  **Run the Algorithm:** Click the **Run** button.

### 4. Understanding the Outputs

The tool will create two new layers, now enhanced with fields for tracking the status of each visit.

-   **Visit Points (Ordered):** A point layer showing the addresses to be visited. Its Attribute Table contains `crew_id`, `visit_order`, and `cost` (travel time/distance) fields to guide the crews, along with new fields for data collection.
-   **Door Knock List (Table):** A non-spatial table formatted for easy export to a CSV file for use in the field. To export, right-click the layer, select `Export > Save Features As...`, and choose "Comma Separated Value \[CSV\]".

For details on how to use the new tracking features, see the next section.

### 5. Tracking and Field Data Collection

The outputs are now designed to support field data collection and status tracking, allowing you to monitor the progress and outcomes of the door-knocking campaign.

#### 5.1 New Tracking Fields

Both the `Visit Points` and `Door Knock List` outputs now include the following fields:

-   **Inquiry Date:** Records the date and time a visit was made.
-   **Inquirer ID:** A text field to store the name or ID of the officer/staff member who conducted the visit.
-   **Inquirer Org:** A text field for the organization or agency of the inquirer (e.g., Police, SES, Council).
-   **Outcome:** A crucial field to record the result of the visit. It defaults to **'Outstanding'**. The available options are:
    -   `No Person/s home`
    -   `Residents Contacted`
    -   `Unable to Locate/Attend Address`
    -   `Outstanding`
-   **Notes:** A text field for any additional comments or observations from the field crew.

#### 5.2 Using with QField (Recommended for Field Reporting)

The `Visit Points (Ordered)` layer is pre-configured for seamless use with the QField mobile app. The 'Outcome' field will automatically appear as a dropdown menu.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Install QFieldSync:** In QGIS, go to `Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins...` and install the **QFieldSync** plugin.
2.  **Package for QField:**
    -   Go to `Project > QFieldSync > Package for QField`.
    -   In the dialog, ensure the **Visit Points (Ordered)** layer is checked. You may also want to package a basemap (like OpenStreetMap) for context.
    -   Choose an export directory. This will create a folder containing the project file and data.
3.  **Transfer to Device:** Copy this exported folder to your mobile device in the location where QField looks for projects (typically `<Internal Storage>/QField/`).
4.  **Collect Data in the Field:**
    -   Open the project in the QField app.
    -   Tap on a visit point on the map.
    -   Tap the **Edit** (pencil) icon to open the attribute form.
    -   Select the appropriate status from the **Outcome** dropdown and fill in the other tracking fields.
    -   Save your changes.
5.  **Synchronize Data Back:**
    -   After completing the fieldwork, transfer the project folder back to your computer.
    -   In QGIS, open the project and go to `Project > QFieldSync > Synchronize from QField`.
    -   Point to the modified project folder to pull the changes back into your main QGIS layers. Your `Visit Points` layer will now be updated with the latest status from the field.

#### 5.3 Connecting to a Webform (Advanced)

For organizations that use dedicated web survey platforms (e.g., Survey123, Fulcrum), the `Door Knock List (Table)` can be used as a basis for data collection.

The general workflow is to export the `Door Knock List` to a CSV and import it into your chosen platform to pre-populate surveys for each address. Once data is collected, the results can be exported back out and joined to the `Visit Points` layer in QGIS using a unique identifier (such as an address ID or a combination of fields).

#### 5.4 Updating Records from a CSV (Placeholder for Future Plugin)

*A future plugin is planned to automate the process of updating the master `Visit Points` layer from a completed CSV file. For now, updates can be performed using standard QGIS tools.*

**Manual Workflow:**

1.  Export the `Door Knock List (Table)` to CSV and provide it to field crews.
2.  Once the CSV is filled out and returned, load it back into QGIS via `Layer > Add Layer > Add Delimited Text Layer...`.
3.  In QGIS, open the **Layer Properties** for your original `Visit Points (Ordered)` layer.
4.  Go to the **Joins** tab and click the **+** button to add a new join.
5.  Join your `Visit Points` layer to the newly loaded CSV layer, using a unique field that exists in both (e.g., `ADDRESS_DETAIL_PID` for GNAF data) as the **Join field** and **Target field**.
6.  The data from the CSV will now be linked to your spatial layer for visualization and analysis.

### 6. How to Apply a Prioritisation Method

The Route Planner works on the specific set of addresses you provide. To prioritise visits (e.g., focus on low-lying areas first), you must first filter your address layer *before* running the planner.

**Method 1: Prioritising by Elevation (for Flood Events)** This method ranks addresses by their elevation to identify those likely to be impacted first by rising floodwaters.

1.  **Get Elevation Data:** Use the **Sample raster values** tool from the Processing Toolbox to add elevation data from a DEM (like Mapzen Global Terrain) to your address points.

2.  **Create Priority Ranks:** Use the **Field Calculator** on the new `Sampled` layer to create a new text field (e.g., `Priority_Rank`). Use a `CASE` statement to group addresses into elevation bands (e.g., '1: 0 - 10m', '2: 11 - 20m', etc.).

3.  **Filter and Run:** Right-click your `Sampled` layer, choose **Filter...**, and enter an expression to show only the highest-priority addresses (e.g., `"Priority_Rank" = '1: 0 - 10m'`). Then, run the **Door Knock Route Planner**, using this filtered layer as your **Address Points** input.

**Method 2: Prioritising by Proximity (for Investigations or SAR)** This method ranks addresses based on their distance from a key location, such as a crime scene or a missing person's Last Known Point (LKP).

1.  **Create a Point of Interest:** Create a new temporary point layer and add a single point at your location of interest.

2.  **Create Distance Buffers:** Use the **Buffer** tool to create concentric rings (e.g., at 100m, 200m, 300m) around your Point of Interest.

3.  **Assign Proximity Ranks:** Use the **Join attributes by location** tool to transfer the buffer distance attribute to each address point that falls within a ring.

4.  **Filter and Run:** **Filter** the resulting `Joined layer` to show only addresses within a specific distance (e.g., `"distance" = 100`). Run the **Door Knock Route Planner** using this filtered layer as your **Address Points** input.

### 7. Important Considerations

-   **Performance:** This tool is data-heavy. For best performance, use it on a localised area. Running on very large datasets may cause QGIS to freeze.
-   **Live Events:** The network analysis does **not** account for real-time road closures from flooding or other hazards. During a live event, you may need to break your area into smaller, accessible zones and run the planner for each one.
-   **Incomplete Routes:** If the output shows a "NULL" `cost` for some addresses, it means a route could not be found. This usually happens if your road network layer is incomplete. Try downloading a larger road network extent.
